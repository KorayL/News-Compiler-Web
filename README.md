- The frontend uses React with Axios to fetch data from the backend and Vite as the build tool.
- The backend uses Java's Spring Boot framework to construct a RESTful API and MySQL as the database.
- The web scraper uses Python's BeautifulSoup library to scrape articles from various news sources.
- The project is containerized entirely using Docker compose and served using Nginx.
