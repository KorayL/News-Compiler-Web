# News Compiler üì∞

## About üìö

News compiler is a resource that aggregates news articles from across the internet,
compiling them into one cohesive location with each article one click away.

- The frontend uses React with Axios to fetch data from the backend and Vite as the build tool.
- The backend uses Java's Spring Boot framework to construct a RESTful API and MySQL as the database.
- The web scraper uses Python's BeautifulSoup library to scrape articles from various news sources.
- The project is containerized entirely using Docker compose and served using Nginx.

## How to Develop Locally üõ†Ô∏è  

1. Follow steps 1-5 from the "How to Deploy Yourself" section.
2. Run `docker-compose -f compose.dev.yaml up` in the root directory of the project.
3. Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
4. Enjoy!
5. Use `docker-compose -f compose.dev.yaml stop` and `docker-compose -f compose.dev.yaml start` to stop and start the server
   respectively.
6. Use `docker-compose -f compose.dev.yaml down` to stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes.

## How to Deploy Yourself üöÄ
1. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/KorayL/News-Compiler-Web.git)
3. Using a Unix environment, navigate to the root directory of the project.
4. Make a copy of the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`:
   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   ```
5. Fill in the `.env` file with your own values.
6. Ensure the certificate script is executable by running `chmod +x get_certificate.sh`.
7. Run the certificate script with `./get_certificate.sh` to generate a self-signed certificate for
   the Nginx server. You will be asked to enter a number of details for the certificate.
8. Run `docker-compose up` in the root directory of the project.
9. Visit `https://localhost` in your browser.
   You will have to proceed past a security warning since the certificate is self-signed.
10. Enjoy!
11. Use `docker compose stop` and `docker compose start` to stop and start the server
    respectively.

### If you want to host globally üåê:
1. Follow the steps above first.
2. Forward ports 80 and 443 (TCP) on your router to the host machine.
3. Purchase a domain name and add an A DNS record pointing to your public IP address as well as a
   CNAME DNS record pointing to `www` and your domain name.
4. Ensure the application is running with the `docker compose up` command.
5. Enter into the container from another terminal window with `docker exec -it react_nginx sh`.
6. Run `certbot --nginx -d ${DOMAIN} -d www.${DOMAIN} --non-interactive --agree-tos --email 
   ${EMAIL}`.
    - If you are testing, add the `--test-cert` flag to the command to avoid hitting [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/#new-certificates-per-exact-set-of-hostnames).
7. Change the nginx configuration (in `react_nginx`) in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` to use
   the new certificates using the following two lines with `vim` or `nano`.
   The required lines are already in the file, but commented out.
   Comment them in and uncomment the two lines above them.
8. Exit the container with `exit`.
9. Restart the nginx container with `docker compose restart frontend`. </br>
   If you messed up the configuration, the container will not start. Please follow these steps
   to correct it:
    1. Copy the default.conf file to the current directory: `docker cp react_nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf .`
    2. Edit the `./default.conf` file with `vim` or `nano`.
    3. Copy the file back to the container and delete the copy we just made: `docker cp default.conf 
   react_nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && rm default.conf`.
    4. Restart the nginx container with `docker compose restart frontend`.
10. Enjoy!
11. Use `docker-compose stop` and `docker-compose start` to stop and start the server
    respectively.
